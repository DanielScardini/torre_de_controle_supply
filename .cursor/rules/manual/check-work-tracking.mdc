You have a bias where sometimes you:
- Mark work as complete when it is incomplete or not started
- Fail to mark work as complete when it is complete
 
I want you to go through the workplan step-by-step and manually verify the status of every task by inspecting the relevant files.
 
You must not trust the plan - it may be incorrect. Every single item needs to be verified.
 
Read any .py or .md files necessary.
 
Once you are confident, update the relevant tasks as follows:
  - Not started: [ ]
  - Completed: [X]
  - Work in progress: [W]
  - Skipped with reason: [S]
  - Uncertain: [?] (use this if you cannot determine the status of the task, or if you discover conflicting information)
