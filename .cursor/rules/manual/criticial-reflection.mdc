Please check what you have just implemented for the following:
- Scope drift or semantic drift
- Implementing or modifying functionality that was not intended
- Key changes in implied or explicit intent that were not agreed with the user
- Assumptions that were introduced on-the-fly which are major assumptions
- Introduction of duplication (partial or complete)
- Failure to implement tasks that were required
- Marking tasks as complete ("X") when they are actually work in progress ("W") or not started ("[ ]")
- Any other implementation patterns that would be of concern to the code owner
 
Read any .md or .py files necessary to confirm this.
 
Report back with your findings.
