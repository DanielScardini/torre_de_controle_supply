OK. Develop a plan to solve this problem in a sequence of logical steps (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, …)
 
Each numbered steps should have the following:
- Overall goal
- Tasks/subtasks – use “[ ]” for not started, “[S]” for skipped with reason, “[W]” for work in progress, “[X]” for completed
- Key files to modify (if known)
- Key primitives (classes, functions, etc) that are relevant
- Reference files and documents: e.g. .py, .md files that are relevant to this
- Notes from planner: Hints, instructions, guidance from the planner to the implementer
- Implementer scratchpad: Keep track of specific things as you go. (This should be blank to start)
 
Format:
- Do not use emoji symbols anywhere, including "✅". This is unprofessional in this context.
- For tracking, use as appropriate:
  - Not started: [ ]
  - Completed: [X]
  - Work in progress: [W]
  - Skipped with reason: [S]
- Unless you find evidence to the contrary, all tasks should be marked “[ ]” as “not started” initially
 
To develop this plan:
- Understand what you have been asked
- Make sure you fully understand what’s being asked before developing the plan. Read any .py files or .md files necessary to confirm your understanding
- Only once you understand the problem sufficiently should you develop the plan
